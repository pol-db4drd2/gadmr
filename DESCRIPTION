Description: GADM (<https://gadm.org>) wants to map the administrative areas of 
    all countries, at all levels of sub-division. GADM provides maps and spatial 
    data for all countries and their sub-divisions for download from its
    website. This package facilitates access to these maps and spatial data for
    download in R.
